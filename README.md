This repository contains two folders "Assignments" and "Labs". The labs folder contains practise coursework as each topic was covered and is not gradable. The assignment folder contains the work to be graded as we progressed through the module. There are 3 assignments in this folder in addition to online quizzes completed. 

1. assignment01-Library: this is an xml representation of books from a library
2. assignment03-CSO: this is a python program that retrieves a dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json"
3. assignment04-github: this is a python program that will read a file from a repository, and replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with my name "Sadie" and then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository.


Python 3.9.13 was used to create the python scripts. Any version of Python 3 can run these scripts. Detailed instructions on how to download and install the latest version of Python are available at https://realpython.com/installing-python/.
